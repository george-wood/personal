I'm a Moore-Sloan Faculty Fellow in the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at New York University. Before joining NYU, I held postdoctoral positions at Northwestern University and Yale University. I received my PhD from [Nuffield College, University of Oxford](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/) in 2017.

I study inequality and discrimination in criminal justice. My projects examine disparities in police deployment, the effects of police militarization, and discrimination in police use of force, stop and search, and arrests. I evaluate programs and interventions that aim to reduce gunshot victimization, police misconduct, and police use of force. I also develop tools to enhance transparency and accountability in policing.

I teach [Responsible Data Science](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/rds/). This technical course covers algorithmic fairness, ethics, data quality, privacy, and transparency of data and algorithms.
