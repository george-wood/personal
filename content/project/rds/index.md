title: Responsible Data Science
summary: 'The first wave of data science focused on accuracy and efficiency: what can we do with data? The second wave is about responsibility: what should we do and not do? Responsible Data Science is a technical course that covers algorithmic and counterfactual fairness, data protection and privacy, transparency, and interpretability. Students tackle these issues and complete weekly lab exercises in Python. In these labs, students inspect machine learning pipelines, implement privacy techniques, and audit black box models, among other exercises.'
